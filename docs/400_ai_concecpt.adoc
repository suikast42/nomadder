SPEC-1-NomadAgenticMonitor

Background

You have an existing system that monitors a HashiCorp Nomad cluster using the Grafana LGTM (Loki, Grafana, Tempo, Mimir) stack and the open-source tool Nomadder. The goal is to add an agentic layer to this system using a Spring Boot service that communicates with a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server, enabling intelligent, autonomous diagnostics using an AGI reasoning engine.

This Spring Boot service will periodically gather logs and metrics from LGTM or Nomadder endpoints, format them into MCP context objects, and send them to an AGI agent. The agent will interpret the data, return diagnoses, and suggest actions that the Spring Boot app can log or act upon.

Requirements

Must Have

[M] Communicate with MCP-compatible AGI over HTTP/WebSocket using JSON.

[M] Query Grafana Mimir and Loki for system metrics and logs.

[M] Aggregate and forward data to an AGI agent via MCP.

[M] Parse agentic responses to detect diagnoses and actionable insights.

[M] Trigger alerting or audit logging based on responses.

Should Have

[S] REST endpoint to trigger ad-hoc diagnostics.

[S] Pluggable agent tools (e.g., restart node, post Slack message).

Could Have

[C] Database to persist diagnostics and agent decisions.

[C] Frontend dashboard to visualize system health and agent output.

Won’t Have (in MVP)

[W] Direct node remediation or job control in Nomad.

[W] Multi-cluster or Kubernetes integration.

Components

Spring Boot MCP Agent

Scheduled job: fetch metrics & logs

WebSocket/HTTP MCP client

JSON serialization/deserialization of context

Tool registry for AGI action hooks

Grafana LGTM Stack

Mimir: Prometheus API for metrics

Loki: log querying by job or label

AGI Reasoner (via MCP)

Accepts context payloads with observability data

Responds with diagnoses and suggested actions

Persistence (optional)

PostgreSQL schema:

CREATE TABLE observations (
id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
timestamp TIMESTAMP,
source TEXT,
context JSONB
);

CREATE TABLE diagnoses (
id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
observation_id UUID REFERENCES observations(id),
severity TEXT,
message TEXT,
actions JSONB,
created_at TIMESTAMP
);

MCP Message Example

Observation sent to AGI:

{
"type": "context.observation",
"payload": {
"nodeStats": {...},
"recentLogs": [...],
"metrics": {...}
}
}

Diagnosis received from AGI:

{
"type": "agent.response",
"payload": {
"diagnosis": "High CPU on node-3",
"severity": "critical",
"actions": [
{"type": "alert.slack", "message": "Node-3 CPU is critical"}
]
}
}

Implementation

Scaffold Spring Boot project with Web + Scheduler + WebSocket

Define DTOs for MCP messages

Implement REST + scheduled data collector

Query LGTM stack via HTTP clients

Format data and send to MCP server

Implement action handlers (e.g., Slack alert)

(Optional) Connect to PostgreSQL and log observations/diagnoses

Milestones

✅ Setup Spring Boot + MCP client

✅ Connect to Loki + Mimir

✅ MCP message exchange with mock AGI

⏳ Implement scheduler and REST endpoint

⏳ Parse AGI response + execute actions

⏳ Alerting and database persistence

⏳ MVP Deployment

Gathering Results

Evaluate correctness of AGI diagnostics vs. known cluster state

Measure latency between data collection and response

Track accuracy of anomaly detection
