=== Persistence with nomad

Nomad handles with two types of persistence.

1. HostPath
2. Over CSI Driver

==== Hostpath persistence
This is a simple mapping from static OS directories with nomad. The volumes to map from the host nomad must statically placed in nomad agents client configuration see <<sample_nomad_host_volume_mapping>>.

After refreshing a entry the nomad service must be restarted.

client {
   enabled = true
   meta{
   host.index=2
}

# The name mysql_data i sused in job config for referencing this volume
host_volume "mysql_data" {
  path      = "/opt/volumes/mysql/data"
  read_only = false
}


----

Advantages:

* Simple to use ( for small size of cluster )
* Fast persistence

Disadvantages:

* The operator of the platform must statically maintain the volumes on every host and restart the agents
* Scaling of stateful workloads is not easy. The operator must define a task per cluster instance see <<_900_link_hasicrop_stack_install_es>>


==== CSI persistence
On the other hand it is possible to handle persistence over a csi driver. Over the CSi dirver the operator can create, snapshot, restore and delete volumes over nomad csi.

Advantages:

* Flexible volume management
* Automated backups and restore of volumes
* Scales for stateful workloads

Disadvantages:

* Depends on your CSI drives slower then native host path
* Needs knowledge of the CSI implementation.
* If the CSI driver not works then every stateful workload not works in the cluster
* Consumes additional CPU and RAM resources on the hosts.

There a lot of CSI implementations:
 * Portworkx: To many important features are enterprise and have to many dependencies to the linux kernel. For example it is not possible to run portworkx on ubuntu 22.04 without downgrading the kernel.
* Cinder: needs a extra dependency for authentication ( Keystone )
* hostpath: is not a production ready implementation.
* kadalu: needs a storage implementation underneath like flusterfs.
* Ceph: Ceph is a candidate for CSI evaluation. Because it doesn't need an external dependency. Define Ceph with cephfs is enough to run the csi driver.See   https://github.com/suikast42/nomadder/issues/30[issue]
