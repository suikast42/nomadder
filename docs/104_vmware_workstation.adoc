=== Settings
Clarify VMWare workstation settings

==== Virtual Machine Settings -> Processors -> Virtualization engine

- Intel VT-x/EPT and AMD-V/RVI +
you only enable that if you want to run a VM in your VM. (nested virtualisation)

- CPU performance counters +
A special use case where you need to measure performance

- Virtual IOMMU +
Needed if you want to enable VBS
IOW, leaving these options unchecked unless you have one of those specific needs is highly recommended.
It will not make your VM faster.
If it does then an application installed in your guest OS is doing something behind your back.
