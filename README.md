What was good in that itteration ? 

 1. Use operator sdk olm for for deployments. 
 2. Implemnt only custom operaotrs if there is no opertors in operator hub.
 3. 
 

Drop the approach of operator that controlls other operators.

New approach

Do not use custom namespaces like stack-x. Try leave the defaults as it is

Evaluate Flux or ArgoCD
